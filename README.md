Aquarius Data Importer
====================

This application imports a variety of external data sources into a local [Aquarius Server](http://www.aquaticinformatics.com/) instance. This solution was created because we don't yet need a full [SCADA solution](http://aquaticinformatics.com/products/aquarius-enviroscada/), so created something smaller. 

Importers are currently available for data hosted with:
* [Sutron](http://www.sutronwin.com/)
* [ViewDataNow from Optimum Instruments](http://vdn5.optinst.com/)

More importers are under development and will be posted to GitHub.
